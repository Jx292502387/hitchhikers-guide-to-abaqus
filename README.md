####_Information, Instructions, Derivations, and Explanations For Use with Abaqus User Subroutines With a Focus on Growth_

This document was born as a compilation of notes and derivations recorded in LaTeX during my doctoral research on the mechanics of the developing human brain.  Over the years and several versions, I have made a lot of additions, consolidations, and corrections.  The focus originally was and still is the UMAT subroutine in Abaqus, but as my own research broadened and I received feedback and input from colleagues, collaborators, and other researchers who found this document useful, I have made some attempts to be more comprehensive.  Above all, my goal is to present in writing a coherent explanation of some of Abaqus' more esoteric quirks for the benefit of future researchers.  I have done my best to accurately attribute my sources; if you find this document useful, please cite the papers in the bibliography where appropriate.  If you find any errors or omissions or have suggestions for ways I could improve this resource, please contact me by [email](maria-holl@nd.edu).

Chapters include:
Chapter | Description 
--- | --- 
1. Introduction to Abaqus Subroutines | Description of various subroutines and how to use them 
2. Abaqus Simulations | Overview of input files and debugging simulations 
3. Constitutive Laws | Background and context for the objective stress rate used by Abaqus 
4. Mechanics of Growth | Derivations based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient 
5. Mechanical Representation of Biological Growth | Information on the options for growth kinematics and kinetics 
6. Sample Growth Models | Complete derivations for several growth models of interest 
along with several appendices that serve as references for continuum mechanics and Fortran.
